          I’ve struggled to write an artist statement for many years now. And really, this is not it. It is difficult to tell what my work is "about". I'm usually rushing to make it, and the ideas are always changing. I have enjoyed making all kinds of art. Now, painting is my favorite. I work from my head, creating a scene's characters, colors, space... I make things up as I go. Sometimes I will put in a color or element that doesn’t work. Painting is really tricky to undo, so I work with those mistakes. I take longs breaks, considering what to do next.

        I work at a museum lab, the <a href="https://studio.carnegiemuseums.org/">Innovation Studio</a>. We’re a small team working on interactive projects for the Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh. I’ve worked on interactive exhibits and apps for the Andy Warhol Museum, Carnegie Museum of Art, and Carnegie Museum of Natural History. I'm particulatly proud of the projects included below. Partly because I played large roles in the UX design and software development but also because I was able to incorporate my own illustrations into these projects. I won't say that I love working in technology, but I do venture to make software that is as beautiful and physical as a painting can be.

        Dawn Chorus is an alarm clock application, available on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dawnchorus">Android</a> and <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/dawn-chorus/id1146931666?ls=1&mt=8">iOS</a>. This app is a calming alternative to your usual blaring alarm. When the alarm goes off, birds join together to create a chorus of song.

I was very excited to create the illustrations, and happy to bring them to life with code.
