          I’ve struggled to write an artist statement for many years now, this is not it. It is difficult for me to evaluate what my work is about as I rush to make it, and the ideas are always changing. I have enjoyed making all kinds of art. Now, painting is my favorite. I work from my head, creating a scene's characters, colors, space... I make things up as I go. Sometimes I will put in a color or element that doesn’t work. Painting is really tricky to undo, so I work with those mistakes. I take longs breaks, considering what to do next.
