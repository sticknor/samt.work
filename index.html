          I’ve struggled to write an artist statement for many years now. And really, this is not it. It is difficult to tell what my work is "about". I'm usually rushing to make it, and the ideas are always changing. I have enjoyed making all kinds of art. Now, painting is my favorite. I work from my head, creating a scene's characters, colors, space... I make things up as I go. Sometimes I will put in a color or element that doesn’t work. Painting is really tricky to undo, so I work with those mistakes. I take longs breaks, considering what to do next.
