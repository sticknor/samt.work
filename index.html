          I enjoy making many kinds of art: painting, drawing, ceramics, hand-drawn animation, computer-generated animation, video games, photography, and collage. I'm always in a rush to make new things. When I see something that sticks to my brain, I have to make something. By the time I [paint] it out of my head, I've already forgot a lot of details. So I make up new characters and lighting and space as I go.

        I work at a museum lab, the <a href="https://studio.carnegiemuseums.org/">Innovation Studio</a>. We’re a small team working on interactive projects for the Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh. I’ve worked on interactive exhibits and apps for the Andy Warhol Museum, Carnegie Museum of Art, and Carnegie Museum of Natural History. I'm particularly proud of the projects included below. In these, I led UX design, software development, and graphic design/illustration. I venture to make software that is as beautiful and physical as a [painting] can be.

        Dawn Chorus is an alarm clock application, available on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dawnchorus">Android</a> and <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/dawn-chorus/id1146931666?ls=1&mt=8">iOS</a>. This app is a calming alternative to your usual blaring alarm. When the alarm goes off, birds join together to create a chorus of song.

        In October 2017, the Studio launched three interactive projects in Carnegie Museum of Natural History’s exhibition <a href="https://carnegiemnh.org/visitor/we-are-nature/">We Are Nature: Living in the Anthropocene</a>. I was very excited to create the illustrations, and happy to bring them to life with code. For further information about these projects, see the <a href="https://github.com/CMP-Studio/WeAreNature">Github repo</a>.
